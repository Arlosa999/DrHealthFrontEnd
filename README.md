## <a name="author"></a>About The Author
I am an inspired entrepreneur and am learning code to find my company one day. Here is my first attempt to build a game to practice front-end development. I look for creative solutions to real-world problems and think of technical ways to address them. While no application is ever perfect, I find joy in the process and all my final products!
